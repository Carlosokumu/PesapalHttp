**Background**

     Design a basic HTTP web-server application which can listen on a configurable TCP port and serve both static HTML and 
     dynamically generated HTML by means of a chosen programming language, such as in the way Apache uses PHP. 
     It is acceptable for this server application to support only a restricted subset of HTTP, such as GET or POST requests, 
     and the only headers it must support are Content-Type and Content-Length.

**Prerequisite**

You need to have the following to run the server in your machine:
- A basic Understanding of [Golang](https://go.dev/) and how to set up your [Go workspace.](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code)
- Go installed in your machine


**Environment Setup**

To ensure you have all the dependencies needed to run the application,run the following command
from the root folder of the project
    go mod tidy
